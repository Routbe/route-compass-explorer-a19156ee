## What Lovable manages

Rules outside this block are the project's own. Change the pieces below in
Lovable, not by hand. With the [Lovable MCP](https://mcp.lovable.dev)
connected, `send_message` asks Lovable to do it; otherwise ask the user to
use the editor.

- **Database.** Do not add or edit `supabase/migrations/` or `drizzle/`.
  Ask Lovable to change the schema.
- **Generated files.** Do not edit a file whose header says it is automatically
  generated.
- **AI gateway.** Keep model calls on Lovable's gateway, and keep
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY` out of browser code.
- **Connectors.** Lovable provides native connectors. `list_connectors` shows
  which are enabled; `add_connector` only returns the dashboard link. When a
  connector is enabled, calls go through the connector gateway and need
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY`. When Lovable does not provide one, users can bring their
  own key and store it in Secrets.
- **Secrets.** Lovable manages them. Do not put secret values in the repo.

## Imported ROUT application
- Preserve the source TanStack routes, providers, assets, and MDX catalog so the original app remains compatible.
- Preserve managed project metadata, generated integrations, and auth attachment when importing source so this project keeps its own identity.
- Keep imported compiler options and MDX compilation while retaining the managed deployment target so source code compiles in this environment.
- Never copy source credentials or apply external database scripts automatically; original accounts and services require explicit compatible configuration.

## Browser cryptography
- Browser encryption, protocol verification and private-key operations use the existing typed crypto-enclave worker with ordered requests, transferred buffers and no UI fallback; shared crypto helpers may still run in server-only handlers. Why: preserves ciphertext compatibility without exposing derived keys to React.
- Zero-fill owned secret/plaintext byte views in finally, hold pending master keys non-extractably and retain vault configuration only as ciphertext; recovery strings/WebAuthn input and engine-internal copies are not erasable or XSS-isolated. Why: cleanup must be testable without claiming a hardware enclave.
- Worker dispatch announces execution start for per-operation deadlines; auth changes terminate volatile state and invalidate captured crypto/HTTP scopes, while owner-keyed UI sessions reject stale completions and preserve persisted device keys. Why: logout, queue delays and late replies must not revive keys or another owner's plaintext.

## Interface materials
- Keep workspace material preferences separate from colour mode; activate root data-theme only for authenticated tools and QR/Studio routes, including their portals, and exclude profile/QR/export artwork. Why: the public gateway retains the imported appearance and Creator restores legacy materials without altering user designs.
